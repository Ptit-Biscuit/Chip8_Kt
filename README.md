# Chip8_Kt

## What?

A CHIP-8 emulator. Very old computer games can run on it.

## Why?

Just because I thought it was fun. Also I never wrote an emulator before this one.

## How?

By the mighty power of Kotlin. Fast and reliable.
(Graphics are done with _openrndr_ library)

## Roadmap

Next steps are:
- Complete documentation
- Add pause and mute controls
- Add keyboard layout configuration
- Try a procedural approach
- Learn how to play some CHIP-8 games

## Notes

Anyone can use this repo to learn Kotlin and/or how a CHIP-8 emulator works.

If you encounter any issue feel free to leave a ticket :)
